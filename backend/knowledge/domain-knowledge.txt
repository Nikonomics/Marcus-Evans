SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT & CALL-OFF COVERAGE
What It Is: Creating, maintaining, and adjusting staff schedules, with particular focus on managing call-offs (staff not showing up for scheduled shifts).
Who Owns It: Scheduler / Staffing Coordinator (with DON oversight)
Typical Process Steps:
	•	Build master schedule (usually 2-4 weeks out)
	•	Receive call-off notification
	•	Calculate coverage need (can we operate short? is agency needed?)
	•	Reach out to internal staff for coverage (texts, calls)
	•	If no internal coverage, contact agency
	•	Confirm coverage and update schedule
	•	Communicate changes to affected staff
	•	Track overtime and agency usage
Systems Involved:
	•	Scheduling software (often basic or spreadsheet-based)

SECTION 5: REGULATORY CONTEXT
CMS Survey Process
What It Is: State survey agencies (on behalf of CMS) conduct unannounced inspections to verify compliance with federal and state requirements. Surveys evaluate quality of care, quality of life, resident rights, and physical environment.
Frequency:
	•	Standard annual survey (every 9-15 months typically)
	•	Complaint surveys (triggered by complaints, any time)
	•	Focused surveys (follow-up on specific issues)
	•	Life Safety Code surveys (fire/safety)
What Surveyors Review:
	•	Resident care and outcomes
	•	Documentation completeness and accuracy
	•	Staff competency and availability
	•	Environment and safety
	•	Resident and family interviews
	•	Staff interviews
	•	Direct observation
Deficiency Process:
	•	Surveyor identifies non-compliance
	•	Assigns F-tag (regulation violated)
	•	Assigns scope (isolated/pattern/widespread) and severity (harm level)
	•	Facility receives Statement of Deficiencies
	•	Facility submits Plan of Correction within 10 days
	•	Follow-up survey verifies correction
F-Tags and Common Citations
What F-Tags Are: F-tags are the regulation numbers in the Code of Federal Regulations (42 CFR 483) that govern nursing home operations. Each F-tag corresponds to a specific requirement.
Most Commonly Cited F-Tags:

Documentation Requirements
Federal Documentation Requirements:
	•	Comprehensive assessment (MDS) within required windows
	•	Care plan for each resident
	•	Progress notes (frequency varies by state)
	•	Physician orders
	•	Medication administration records
	•	Treatment records
	•	Incident reports
	•	Discharge planning documentation
Why Documentation Matters for AI:
	•	AI can help ensure completeness and timeliness
	•	AI can flag missing documentation before survey
	•	AI can assist with documentation creation
	•	AI cannot replace clinical judgment but can support it
Billing Compliance
Key Compliance Concerns:
	•	Billing for services not provided
	•	Billing for services not medically necessary
	•	Upcoding (claiming higher reimbursement than justified)
	•	Unbundling (billing separately for services that should be bundled)
	•	False Claims Act liability
	•	RAC audits and recoupment
Implications for AI:
	•	AI tools must support accurate billing, not maximize billing
	•	Documentation must support codes
	•	AI should flag potential compliance issues, not hide them
	•	Human oversight required for billing decisions
HIPAA Considerations for AI
What Operators Need to Know:
	•	PHI (Protected Health Information) must be secured
	•	AI tools processing PHI must be HIPAA-compliant
	•	Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) required with AI vendors handling PHI
	•	Staff training on appropriate AI use with PHI
	•	Audit trails for AI interactions with PHI
Questions to Ask Vendors:
	•	Is your system HIPAA-compliant?
	•	Will you sign a BAA?
	•	Where is data stored and processed?
	•	How is data protected in transit and at rest?
	•	Can data be deleted if requested?
State Licensure Variations
Key Variations by State:
	•	Staffing ratio requirements
	•	Training requirements
	•	Survey protocols
	•	Medicaid reimbursement rates
	•	Medicaid eligibility rules
	•	Prior authorization requirements
	•	Documentation standards
	•	Facility licensure requirements
States with Notably Different Regulations:
	•	California (high staffing requirements, unique survey process)
	•	Florida (large market, specific regulations)
	•	New York (complex Medicaid system)
	•	Texas (large market, variable regulations by region)

SECTION 6: TECHNOLOGY LANDSCAPE
Dominant EHR Systems
PointClickCare (PCC)
	•	Market leader in SNF (~75% market share)
	•	Comprehensive platform: clinical, financial, analytics
	•	Known for robust functionality but complexity
	•	Integration hub for many other systems
	•	Most operators are familiar with PCC
MatrixCare
	•	Strong in ALF and post-acute
	•	Part of ResMed
	•	Competitive with PCC in functionality
	•	Different user interface paradigm
American HealthTech (AHT)
	•	Older system, still in use
	•	Being sunset by some operators
	•	Limited modern functionality
Other EHR Systems:
	•	NetHealth (therapy-focused)
	•	Casamba (therapy documentation)
	•	Experience Care
	•	SigmaCare
Billing Systems
Standalone Billing Systems:
	•	Some operators use separate billing systems from EHR
	•	Integration with EHR is often incomplete
	•	Creates reconciliation burden
Billing Modules Within EHR:
	•	PCC has robust billing
	•	Integration is better when billing is native to EHR
Scheduling Systems
Common Scheduling Solutions:
	•	PCC Scheduling module
	•	Kronos
	•	UKG (formerly Ultimate Kronos Group)
	•	SmartLinx
	•	OnShift
	•	Spreadsheets (still very common)
The Reality: Many facilities still manage schedules in Excel or Google Sheets, with text messaging for coverage. Even with scheduling software, the call-off coverage process is often manual.
Therapy Documentation
Dedicated Therapy Systems:
	•	Net Health (Optima)
	•	Casamba
	•	WebPT
	•	Rehab Optima
Integration Challenges: Therapy documentation often lives in a separate system from nursing EHR, creating challenges for Section GG alignment and care coordination.
Dietary Systems
Common Systems:
	•	CBORD
	•	Computrition
	•	MealTracker
	•	Dietary Mgr module in EHR
How Systems Don't Talk to Each Other
The Integration Problem:
	•	EHR, billing, scheduling, therapy, dietary often operate independently
	•	Staff enter the same information multiple times
	•	Data doesn't flow automatically
	•	Reconciliation is manual
	•	"Source of truth" doesn't exist for many data points
Examples of Integration Failures:
	•	Census in EHR doesn't match billing system
	•	Therapy minutes in therapy system don't flow to MDS
	•	Dietary orders in EHR don't update in kitchen system
	•	Staffing in scheduling system doesn't match payroll
	•	Physician orders entered twice (EHR + pharmacy)
Why This Matters for AI:
	•	AI opportunity: connect disparate data
	•	AI challenge: data quality varies across systems
	•	Integration is often the limiting factor, not AI capability

How to Engage Decision-Makers
Lead with Their Pain:
	•	Start with problems they recognize
	•	Use their language
	•	Acknowledge the difficulty of their job
	•	Show you understand their world
Show Proof, Not Promise:
	•	Case studies from similar facilities
	•	Measurable results
	•	References they can call
	•	Pilots before enterprise commitments
Reduce Risk:
	•	Offer pilots with low commitment
	•	Define clear success criteria
	•	Provide failure insurance (kill criteria)
	•	Don't require massive change upfront
Respect Their Expertise:
	•	They know their buildings better than anyone
	•	Ask questions, don't lecture
	•	Position yourself as a partner, not an expert who knows better
	•	Listen more than you talk
Make it Easy:
	•	Minimize implementation burden
	•	Provide clear next steps
	•	Don't add to their already-full plate
	•	Meet them where they are
Address the Fear of AI Replacing People:
	•	Lead with reassurance: AI reduces workload, not headcount
	•	Show that staff will benefit
	•	Acknowledge the demographic reality
	•	Frame AI as protecting people, not eliminating them

SECTION 9: THE DEMOGRAPHIC REALITY
The Numbers That Matter
Aging Population:
	•	Adults 85+ will double in coming decades
	•	By 2030, 1 in 5 Americans will be 65+
	•	By 2034, more seniors than children for first time in U.S. history
	•	The population needing care is exploding
Workforce Crisis:
	•	Working-age population is flat
	•	Current caregiver shortage: hundreds of thousands
	•	Projected shortage by 2030: 1 million+
	•	Turnover rates of 50-100% make shortages worse
	•	Immigration policy affects pipeline
The Math:
	•	More residents needing care
	•	Fewer workers available to provide care
	•	No amount of recruiting can solve this
	•	Wage increases are necessary but not sufficient
	•	The only scalable answer: reduce workload per person
What This Means for AI
AI is not optional—it's necessary:
	•	The math doesn't work without load reduction
	•	AI is the only lever that scales
	•	Every hour saved is an hour available for care
	•	Operators who adopt AI early will survive and thrive
	•	Those who wait will face staffing crises they cannot solve
The framing that works:
	•	"AI isn't replacing people. AI is reducing the workload per person so we can keep up with the demographic wave that's already here."
	•	"We cannot hire our way out of this."
	•	"AI is how we protect our staff from burning out."
