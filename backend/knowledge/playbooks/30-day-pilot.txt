30-DAY AI PILOT PLAYBOOK
A Step-by-Step Guide from Workflow Selection to Pilot Completion
For Senior Living Operators
Overview
This playbook guides you through a controlled 30-day AI pilot. The goal is simple: prove value with one workflow in one building before scaling. Follow this day-by-day to minimize risk and maximize learning.
What You'll Achieve:
	•	Document your current workflow reality (not the ideal)
	•	Define measurable success criteria
	•	Select and evaluate the right tool
	•	Run a controlled test with clear decision points
	•	Make a confident kill/pivot/scale decision
WEEK 1: Document Current State
Goal: Capture exactly how work happens today—not the policy version, the real version.
Day 1: Identify Your Workflow Hero
Your 'Hero' is the person who owns the workflow you're piloting. They know every shortcut, every workaround, every frustration.
Morning Actions:
	•	Confirm your selected workflow from discovery phase
	•	Identify the 1-2 people who do this work most often
	•	Schedule a 2-hour shadow session with your primary Hero
	•	Set up screen recording tool (Loom free tier works perfectly)
Afternoon Actions:
	•	Have initial conversation with Hero—explain purpose, get buy-in
	•	Ask: 'What do you wish you could change about this process?'
	•	Ask: 'Where do errors usually happen?'
	•	Ask: 'What would make this 10x better?'
Hero Conversation Script:
"Hey [Name], I'm working on a project to reduce the administrative burden in our building. I know you handle [workflow] and I've heard it can be painful. I want to understand exactly how you do it—not the textbook way, but the real way. Would you be willing to let me shadow you for a couple hours? I want to record your screen so I can capture every step. The goal isn't to evaluate you—it's to find where AI might help."
End of Day Checklist:
	•	☐ Shadow session scheduled for Day 2 or 3
	•	☐ Hero understands purpose and is bought in
	•	☐ Screen recording tool tested and working
	•	☐ Initial pain points documented
Days 2-3: Shadow and Record
This is where the real gold lives. Watch everything. Capture everything.
Shadow Session Guidelines:
	•	Record the entire session (with permission)
	•	Ask them to narrate: 'What are you doing now? Why?'
	•	Note every system they touch (PCC, Excel, email, text, paper)
	•	Count clicks, copy/pastes, and screen switches
	•	Document 'wait time' (when system is loading, searching, etc.)
	•	Listen for sighs, 'ugh', and 'hold on' moments—those are friction signals
Questions to Ask During Shadow:
	•	'Why do you do it this way?'
	•	'What happens if you skip this step?'
	•	'Does it ever go differently?'
	•	'What's the worst version of this you've dealt with?'
	•	'If you're out sick, who covers? Do they know all this?'
What to Document:
	•	Total time to complete one instance of the workflow
	•	Number of systems touched
	•	Number of manual steps (copy/paste, data entry, switching screens)
	•	Where information gets 'stuck' or requires hunting
	•	Error-prone steps
	•	Workarounds they've invented
Days 4-5: Build Your Workflow Map
Convert your shadowing into a clear process document.
Create a Workflow Map with:
	•	Trigger: What starts this workflow? (admission, call-off, payer request, etc.)
	•	Steps: Every action in order, including 'invisible' steps like waiting
	•	Systems: Every tool touched (PCC, Excel, email, paper, text)
	•	Time: How long each step takes
	•	Friction Points: Where pain happens
	•	Output: What the completed workflow produces
Validate with Your Hero:
Share your workflow map with the Hero and ask: 'Did I get this right?' Make corrections. This becomes your baseline.
Week 1 Deliverables:
	•	☐ Screen recording of actual workflow (2-4 hours of footage)
	•	☐ Written workflow map (trigger → steps → systems → time → output)
	•	☐ List of top 3-5 friction points ranked by severity
	•	☐ Hero's wish list for improvement
	•	☐ Baseline metrics (time per instance, error rate, volume)
Common Week 1 Mistakes:
	•	❌ Documenting the 'policy' version instead of the real version
	•	❌ Not recording the session (you'll forget details)
	•	❌ Rushing the shadow—you need to see the full workflow at least twice
	•	❌ Not validating the map with the Hero
WEEK 2: Define Success & Select Tool
Goal: Establish clear success criteria and identify the right solution.
Days 6-7: Define Success Metrics
If you can't measure success, you can't declare victory or failure. Define metrics now.
Primary Metrics (Pick 2-3):
Metric
How to Measure
Success Threshold
Time Saved
Stopwatch 10 instances before/after
30%+ reduction
Touches Removed
Count manual steps before/after
50%+ reduction
Error Rate
Track corrections needed per 20 instances
Equal or better
Team Satisfaction
1-10 rating weekly from Hero
7+ average
Success Criteria Statement Template:
"This pilot will be successful if we reduce [workflow] time from [X hours] to [Y hours] per [week/instance], while maintaining or improving accuracy, and the team rates their experience 7+ out of 10."
Days 8-10: Classify & Select Solution
Determine what type of AI you need, then find the right tool.
Step 1: Classify Your Workflow
Use the TRUST Framework to determine if you need an Assistant or Agent:
TRUST Factor
→ Assistant
→ Agent
Time Sensitivity
Hours/Days (human available)
Seconds/Minutes (no human available)
Risk Tolerance
High stakes (need human check)
Low stakes (mistakes fixable)
Uniformity
<80% predictable
80%+ follows same pattern
Staff Capacity
Staff has bandwidth to review
Staff overwhelmed—need full handoff
Training Investment
Need quick win (this month)
Can invest 2-3 months
Quick Classification Rule:
	•	Start with Assistants if you're unsure. Lower risk, faster implementation.
	•	Consider Agents only when: no human is available at decision time AND the workflow is 80%+ predictable AND mistakes are easily corrected.
Step 2: Identify Solution Options
Based on your workflow, identify 2-3 potential solutions:
	•	Off-the-shelf tools: Existing products designed for your use case
	•	General AI assistants: ChatGPT/Claude with custom prompts
	•	Custom development: Built specifically for your needs
Week 2 Deliverables:
	•	☐ Written success criteria statement
	•	☐ Baseline measurements documented
	•	☐ TRUST classification completed (Assistant vs Agent)
	•	☐ 2-3 potential solutions identified
	•	☐ Demo requests sent to vendors (if applicable)
WEEK 3: Begin Testing
Goal: Start using the solution on real work and track results.
Days 11-14: Launch Controlled Test
Start small. Very small.
Day 11 - Setup:
	•	Tool/solution configured and accessible to Hero
	•	Hero has received basic training (30-60 minutes max)
	•	Tracking spreadsheet created (date, time, notes, issues)
	•	Daily check-in time scheduled (15 minutes)
Days 12-14 - First Tests:
	•	Process 3-5 instances per day with the new tool
	•	Hero documents: What worked? What didn't? How long did it take?
	•	You review outputs for accuracy
	•	Daily 15-minute debrief with Hero
Daily Check-In Questions:
	•	How many instances did you process today?
	•	What was the average time per instance?
	•	Did you encounter any errors or issues?
	•	On a scale of 1-10, how was the experience today?
	•	Anything that frustrated you or confused you?
Days 15-21: Expand & Iterate
If Week 3 Day 11-14 goes well, expand volume. If not, troubleshoot.
Volume Ramp:
	•	Days 15-17: Process 5-10 instances per day
	•	Days 18-21: Process all instances that arise naturally
Weekly Review Meeting (Day 17 or 18):
Conduct 30-minute review with Hero and stakeholders:
	•	Review metrics vs. baseline
	•	Discuss surprises (good and bad)
	•	Identify needed adjustments
	•	Get Hero's honest assessment
Week 3 Deliverables:
	•	☐ 20+ instances processed with new tool
	•	☐ Daily tracking data compiled
	•	☐ Week 3 metrics vs. baseline comparison
	•	☐ Issues log with resolutions
	•	☐ Hero satisfaction rating
WEEK 4: Evaluate & Decide
Goal: Make a clear kill/pivot/scale decision based on data.
Days 22-26: Final Testing & Data Collection
Continue processing all instances. Focus on collecting clean data.
Final Week Requirements:
	•	Process minimum 30 total instances
	•	Time at least 10 instances with stopwatch
	•	Review all outputs for accuracy
	•	Conduct final satisfaction survey with Hero and any other users
Days 27-30: Decision & Documentation
Compile results and make your decision.

Failure Insurance: Kill / Pivot / Scale
Use these decision rules to make a clear choice.
KILL the Pilot If:
Stop immediately and do not scale. The approach isn't working.
	•	It adds more steps than it removes
	•	The Hero actively hates it
	•	Error rate increased
	•	It requires major retraining that staff can't absorb
	•	It disrupts care or compliance
	•	Time savings are <15%
	•	Team satisfaction is <5/10
PIVOT the Pilot If:
The workflow is right, but the solution isn't. Try a different tool.
	•	Workflow shows clear AI potential, but this tool is clunky
	•	Results are mixed—some things work, some don't
	•	Team likes the concept but not the execution
	•	A specific feature is missing that another tool might have
	•	Integration issues that might not exist with alternatives
SCALE the Pilot If:
Success! Plan your rollout.
	•	Time savings >30%
	•	Touches reduced >50%
	•	Error rate equal or better
	•	Team satisfaction 7+/10
	•	Hero says: 'I never want to go back to the old way'
ROI Quick Calculation
Use this formula to estimate annual value:
Annual ROI = (Time Saved per Instance × Volume per Year × Hourly Cost) – Annual Tool Cost
Example:
	•	Time saved: 20 minutes per instance
	•	Volume: 500 instances per year
	•	Hourly cost: $35/hour
	•	Tool cost: $500/month = $6,000/year
ROI = (0.33 hours × 500 × $35) – $6,000 = $5,775 – $6,000 = -$225
In this example, the tool doesn't pay for itself. Need more volume or time savings.
Better Example:
	•	Time saved: 45 minutes per instance
	•	Volume: 1,000 instances per year
	•	Hourly cost: $35/hour
	•	Tool cost: $500/month = $6,000/year
ROI = (0.75 hours × 1,000 × $35) – $6,000 = $26,250 – $6,000 = $20,250/year
