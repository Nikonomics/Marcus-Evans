FIRST WEEK DISCOVERY PLAYBOOK
Identify Your First 10-20 AI Opportunities in 5 Days
The 4-Touch Discovery Method
Overview
This playbook helps you identify 10-20 AI opportunities within your organization in just one week. By the end of Friday, you'll have a prioritized list of workflows ready for AI implementation.
The 4-Touch Discovery Method:
	•	Monday: Pain Point Inventory — Ask your leaders what hurts
	•	Tuesday-Wednesday: Spreadsheet Census — Find your power users
	•	Thursday: Friday Afternoon Audit Prep — Plan your walkthrough
	•	Friday: The Friday Afternoon Audit — See what piles up
What You'll Have by Friday:
	•	A list of 10-20 specific workflow pain points
	•	Identified 'Spreadsheet Heroes' who hold critical processes
	•	Prioritized scoring of each opportunity
	•	Your top 3 candidates for AI pilots
MONDAY: Pain Point Inventory
Goal: Collect pain points directly from department heads and key staff.
Morning: Send the Discovery Email
Send the following email to all department heads and key operational staff by 9 AM.

Subject: Quick Question - What's Your Team's Biggest Time-Waster?

Hi Team,

I'm working on a project to reduce administrative burden in our organization. I need your honest input.

Please answer these 3 questions (spend no more than 5 minutes total):

1. What task makes your best person curse at their computer?
2. What would you celebrate never doing again?
3. What workflow do you personally avoid until you absolutely have to do it?

Please reply by end of day Wednesday. Short answers are perfect.

Thanks!

Monday End-of-Day Checklist:
	•	☐ Discovery email sent to all department heads
	•	☐ Discovery tracker created
	•	☐ Calendar blocked for Friday 2-4 PM walkthrough
TUESDAY-WEDNESDAY: Spreadsheet Census
Goal: Identify your 'Spreadsheet Heroes' — the people who keep your organization running with Excel files, manual trackers, and workarounds.
How to Identify Spreadsheet Heroes
Spreadsheet Heroes are the staff members who:
	•	Maintain complex Excel files that multiple people depend on
	•	Have created workarounds because systems don't talk to each other
	•	Are the 'go-to' person when something breaks
	•	When they're out sick, things fall apart
Where to Look:
	•	Scheduling: Ask who builds and manages the staffing schedules
	•	Billing: Ask who tracks denials, AR aging, or payer rules
	•	MDS: Ask who cross-references assessments and documentation
	•	Admissions: Ask who manages the referral pipeline or packet assembly
	•	Quality: Ask who compiles Key Factors, QAPI data, or survey prep
Questions to Ask Each Hero (15-minute conversation)
Schedule 15 minutes with each identified Hero. Use these questions:
Opening:
"I'm trying to understand where our organization spends the most time on manual work. I've heard you maintain some important spreadsheets and processes. Can I ask you a few questions?"
Discovery Questions:
	•	What spreadsheets or files do you maintain?
	•	How often do you update them? (Daily? Weekly?)
	•	How long does each update take?
	•	Where does the data come from? (What systems do you pull from?)
	•	If you won the lottery tomorrow, who would know how to do this?
	•	What's the worst part of this process?
	•	If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?
How to Shadow Effectively
If a Hero has a particularly complex workflow, ask to shadow them for 30-60 minutes.
Shadow Session Guidelines:
	•	Ask permission to observe without interrupting
	•	Have them narrate what they're doing: "Now I'm copying this from..."
	•	Count: systems touched, tabs open, copy/paste actions
	•	Note every 'ugh' moment, sigh, or workaround
	•	Ask after: 'Does it ever go faster than this?'
What to Record:
Capture This
Why It Matters
Number of systems touched
More systems = more integration friction
Copy/paste count
Each paste = potential error and wasted time
Total time to complete
Baseline for measuring improvement
Workarounds described
Shows system limitations
Frequency of task
Higher frequency = higher AI ROI
Tuesday-Wednesday Checklist:
	•	☐ Identified 3-5 Spreadsheet Heroes across departments
	•	☐ Conducted 15-minute interviews with each
	•	☐ Shadowed at least one complex workflow
	•	☐ Added all discovered workflows to Discovery Tracker
	•	☐ Email responses starting to come in
THURSDAY: Friday Afternoon Audit Prep
Goal: Prepare for your Friday walkthrough and compile responses.
Morning: Process Email Responses
Review all responses to your Monday email. For each pain point mentioned:
	•	Add it to your Discovery Tracker
	•	Note who mentioned it
	•	Flag if multiple people mentioned the same thing (strong signal!)
	•	Estimate frequency and severity
Response Patterns to Watch For:
	•	Multiple mentions of the same task: Strong candidate
	•	Emotional language ("hate," "nightmare," "killing us"): High pain
	•	Time estimates included: Good for ROI calculation
	•	System names mentioned: Helps scope solution
Afternoon: Plan Your Friday Walkthrough
The Friday Afternoon Audit is your most powerful discovery tool. Tasks that pile up on Friday afternoon are always high-friction, high-urgency, and repetitive.
Walkthrough Route Planning:
Identify which areas you'll visit. Plan to spend 10-15 minutes in each:
	•	Nursing station
	•	Business office
	•	Admissions
	•	Scheduler's desk
	•	MDS coordinator
	•	Administrator's office
Prepare Your Script:
"Hey [Name], it's almost the weekend! I'm trying to understand where administrative work piles up. Real quick — what are you working on right now that you're trying to finish before you leave? Anything you're pushing to Monday?"
Thursday Checklist:
	•	☐ All email responses processed and added to tracker
	•	☐ Walkthrough route planned
	•	☐ Script prepared
	•	☐ Notepad/tablet ready for tomorrow
	•	☐ Follow up with non-responders
FRIDAY: The Friday Afternoon Audit
Goal: Walk your facility at 2-3 PM and capture every piece of work that's piling up.
2:00-3:30 PM: The Walkthrough
Visit each area on your planned route. At each stop:
Questions to Ask:
	•	"What are you still working on right now?"
	•	"What are you pushing to Monday?"
	•	"What would break or fall behind if you left right now?"
	•	"Is this the same every Friday, or just today?"
	•	"What's the most annoying part of this task?"
What Friday Pileup Indicates:
What You See
What It Means
Tasks pushed to Monday
Workload exceeds capacity
Same task every Friday
Predictable, repetitive = AI-ready
Someone staying late
High urgency, can't wait
Frustration or eye-rolling
High annoyance, low value
Multiple spreadsheets open
Manual data reconciliation
3:30-5:00 PM: Compile and Score
Return to your desk and finalize your Discovery Tracker.
Scoring Formula:
Priority Score = Frequency (1-3) × Pain Level (1-3) × People Affected (1-3)
Maximum score = 27. Minimum score = 1.
Scoring Guide:
	•	Frequency: Daily = 3, Weekly = 2, Monthly = 1
	•	Pain Level: High = 3, Medium = 2, Low = 1
	•	People Affected: Many (5+) = 3, Some (2-4) = 2, Few (1) = 1
What Your Scores Mean:
	•	18-27: Immediate opportunity — start here
	•	9-17: Strong candidate — evaluate next
	•	1-8: Lower priority — table for later
End of Week: Your Deliverables
By end of day Friday, you should have:
	•	☐ Discovery Tracker with 10-20 workflow pain points
	•	☐ Each workflow scored using Priority formula
	•	☐ Identified 3-5 Spreadsheet Heroes
	•	☐ Ranked list with top 3 opportunities highlighted
