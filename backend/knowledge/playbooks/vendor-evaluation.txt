VENDOR EVALUATION PLAYBOOK
How to Evaluate AI Vendors Without Getting Sold
The BS Detector Guide for Senior Living Operators
Overview
AI vendors are eager to sell. Your job is to separate substance from hype. This playbook gives you a structured process to evaluate vendors, ask the right questions, and avoid common traps.
The 4-Phase Evaluation Process:
	•	Initial Screening — Before you agree to a demo
	•	Demo Evaluation — What to watch for
	•	Reference Checks — Talking to real customers
	•	Pilot Terms Negotiation — Protecting yourself
Golden Rule:
"If a vendor can't clearly explain what their AI actually does, they're selling magic, not technology."
PHASE 1: Initial Screening
Goal: Filter vendors before you invest time in demos. Ask these questions via email or initial call.
15 Critical Questions to Ask Before Demo
Send these questions to any vendor before agreeing to a full demo:
Question
Why You're Asking
1. How many SNF/ALF customers do you have?
Tests industry experience
2. Can you provide 3 references our size?
Validates claims with real customers
3. What workflow specifically do you solve?
Ensures focus, not 'boil the ocean'
4. What exactly does the AI do vs. what humans do?
Separates real AI from marketing
5. Does your solution add steps or remove steps?
AI should reduce work, not add it
6. What systems do you integrate with?
Must work with your existing stack
7. Do you integrate with PCC specifically?
Critical for most SNFs
8. What's your typical implementation timeline?
Tests realistic expectations
9. What training is required for staff?
Hidden cost of adoption
10. Do you offer a pilot program?
Must try before full commitment
11. What metrics do your customers track?
Should match your success criteria
12. What ROI do similar customers achieve?
Benchmarks for your expectations
13. What's the pricing structure?
Understand total cost
14. What happens if it doesn't work?
Exit clause is essential
15. Who is our point of contact after sale?
Tests ongoing support quality
Red Flags vs. Green Flags in Responses
🚩 RED FLAGS — Walk Away If You Hear:
	•	"Our AI will transform your entire operation"
	•	"We don't really do pilots—it's better to start full-scale"
	•	"We work with all healthcare" (no SNF-specific experience)
	•	"It's hard to explain exactly what the AI does"
	•	"We're still building the integration with PCC"
	•	"Our customers see ROI within days" (unrealistic)
	•	"We can't share references due to privacy" (hiding something)
	•	Pricing requires a long-term contract upfront
	•	They avoid the 'what happens if it doesn't work' question
✅ GREEN FLAGS — Take Them Seriously If You Hear:
	•	"We focus specifically on [your exact workflow]"
	•	"Let me connect you with 3 facilities like yours"
	•	"We recommend a 30-60 day pilot"
	•	"Here's exactly what the AI does vs. what your staff does"
	•	"We integrate directly with PCC" (or your EHR)
	•	"Typical results take 30-60 days to appear"
	•	"Here's what we can't do" (honest about limitations)
	•	Clear pricing with pilot option
	•	"If it doesn't work, here's our exit process"
PHASE 2: Demo Evaluation
Goal: Evaluate the solution with clear criteria. Bring the right people. Ask the right questions.
What to Request Before the Demo
	•	Live demo, not a slide deck. "Show me the actual product."
	•	Demo with your workflow. "Can you show this with a prior auth scenario?" (or whatever workflow you're solving)
	•	Step-by-step walkthrough. "Walk me through from trigger to completion."
	•	Error scenario. "Show me what happens when something goes wrong."
Who Should Attend
Always bring the person who actually does the work.
	•	Required: The 'Workflow Hero' who owns the process
	•	Recommended: Department head who will approve
	•	Optional: IT (only if integration is complex)
Why the Hero must attend:
They know the real workflow. They'll spot gaps the vendor glosses over. They'll know if it actually removes steps or adds them.
Demo Evaluation Scorecard
Score each criterion 1-5 during the demo:
Criterion
Score (1-5)
Notes
Workflow match: Solves YOUR specific problem
__/5

Step reduction: Actually removes work, not adds it
__/5

Ease of use: Hero could learn this in <2 hours
__/5

Integration: Works with your current systems
__/5

Error handling: Clear process when things go wrong
__/5

AI clarity: Clear explanation of what AI does
__/5

Hero reaction: Your workflow owner is excited
__/5

TOTAL:
__/35

Score Interpretation:
	•	28-35: Strong candidate—move to references
	•	21-27: Potential—clarify concerns before proceeding
	•	<21: Pass—not the right fit
PHASE 3: Reference Checks
Goal: Talk to real customers. Get the unfiltered truth.
Request Specific References
Don't accept generic references. Ask for:
	•	A facility similar to your size
	•	A facility that's been using the solution for 6+ months
	•	A facility that had a challenging implementation (yes, ask for this)
15 Questions for References
Ask each reference these questions. Take notes.
Implementation Questions:
	•	How long did implementation really take?
	•	What surprised you during implementation?
	•	How much staff training was required?
	•	What was the hardest part of getting started?
Results Questions:
	•	What specific results have you measured?
	•	How long before you saw real results?
	•	Does it actually save time, or did it add new work?
	•	What's the ROI you're seeing?
Experience Questions:
	•	What does your staff think of the tool?
	•	What's the worst thing about working with this vendor?
	•	What do you wish you'd known before signing?
	•	How responsive is support when things break?
	•	If you had to do it again, would you choose them?
The Killer Question:
	•	"Is there anything I should have asked that I didn't?"
What to Listen For (Between the Lines)
What They Say
What It Might Mean
"My team would mutiny if we took it away"
✅ Strong adoption signal
"It took a while to get used to"
⚠️ Plan for longer adoption
"Support was...okay"
🚩 Dig deeper—probably bad
Specific metrics and numbers
✅ Real results, not fluff
Vague: "It's been helpful"
🚩 May not have measured anything
PHASE 4: Pilot Terms Negotiation
Goal: Protect yourself with the right contract terms before committing.
What Good Pilots Include
	•	Duration: 30-60 days minimum. 90 days ideal.
	•	Scope: ONE building, ONE workflow
	•	Success criteria: Defined upfront in writing
	•	Support: Named contact, response time SLA
	•	Exit clause: Can end with 30-day notice
	•	Pricing: Discounted or free during pilot
What to Avoid in Contracts
	•	❌ Multi-year commitment required for pilot: Never.
	•	❌ Auto-renewal clauses: Require written opt-in.
	•	❌ All-buildings commitment: Pilot should be 1 building only.
	•	❌ Vague success criteria: Must be specific and measurable.
	•	❌ Termination penalties: Pilot should have easy exit.
Pricing Red Flags
	•	Per-bed pricing that doesn't scale
	•	Hidden implementation fees
	•	Training charged separately
	•	Support tiers that require upgrade for basics
	•	Significant price increases after year 1
Exit Clause Essentials
Your contract MUST include:
	•	Written 30-day termination notice
	•	Data export: You own your data, they must provide it
	•	No termination penalties during pilot
	•	Pro-rated refund if ending mid-term (post-pilot)
The Complete BS Detector Checklist
Use this as your final evaluation tool.
❌ RUN AWAY — Vendor is not serious:
	•	"Our AI will transform everything"
	•	No pilot offered
	•	Can't explain what AI actually does
	•	No SNF/ALF-specific customers
	•	Won't provide references
	•	Requires multi-year commitment before pilot
	•	Solution adds steps instead of removing them
⚠️ INVESTIGATE — Needs clarification:
	•	Limited SNF experience but willing to pilot
	•	Integration "in progress" but not complete
	•	References are all from different industries
	•	Pricing structure is complex
	•	Results take longer than expected
✅ SERIOUS VENDOR — Move forward:
	•	Specific workflow focus
	•	Offers structured pilot
	•	Clear AI explanation
	•	SNF/ALF references available
	•	Honest about limitations
	•	Reasonable timeline expectations
	•	Clear pricing with pilot option
	•	Solution removes steps
Remember: If they can't explain it clearly, they can't deliver it reliably.
